Simulation of Particles in a Box
Current state of project:  
+ Intital Random start positions
+ Intial Random velcoties
+ Particles contained in box
+ Electro-static repulsion
+ Energy absorbing walls

Project Goals:  
+ Streamline code for faster runtimes and increased particle density
+ Analysis of particle energy, position, and box pressure over time
+ Shiny App for input of simulation parameters  
1 Box Dimensions
2 Intial Velcoity value and deviation
3 Number of particles
4 Time to run simulation
+ Convert to a quantum model of interacting wavefronts
+ Addition of single or double slits to observe inference pattern
